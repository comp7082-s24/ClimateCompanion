# ClimateCompanion

## Project Description

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo the first thing to do is run `./prepare` in the project directory to install
all the dependencies needed for the project. For a better consistency don't tamper with `pubspec.lock` manually.

## Pre-commit

Prior to committing any changes, please run the `prepare` script by running `./prepare` in the root directory to ensure that the code is 
formatted correctly and that all tests pass.
